        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to model real-world entities. These objects encapsulate data and the methods that operate on that data. The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects (instances) will have. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "        class Dog:\n",
        "           def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "              self.name = name\n",
        "           def bark(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation with actual values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Encapsulation binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python like __init__, __str__, and __len__, used to define behaviors for objects like construction, printing, and length.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This helps reuse code and establish relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "       class Animal:\n",
        "         def speak(self):\n",
        "             print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "             \n",
        "       class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "         def speak(self):\n",
        "             print(\"Bark!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "         class Bird:\n",
        "            def fly(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Bird flies\")\n",
        "                \n",
        "         class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
        "            def fly(self):\n",
        "                print(\"Sparrow flies\")\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:By using private variables (prefixing with _ or __) and providing getter and setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "       class Bank:\n",
        "          def __init__(self):\n",
        "           self.__balance = 0\n",
        "          def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "           self.__balance += amount\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:The __init__ method in a class is a constructor that initializes object attributes when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " @classmethod: Takes cls as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        " @staticmethod: Does not take self or cls, behaves like a regular function within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, we use default arguments or *args/**kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: @property is used to define a method as a property, allowing method access like an attribute.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Polymorphism increases flexibility and reusability of code, allowing different classes to be treated uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may have abstract methods. It is defined using the abc module.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Reusability through inheritance\n",
        " * Modularity via encapsulation\n",
        " * Flexibility with polymorphism\n",
        " * Maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Class Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    Shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Defined inside the class but outside any methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Changing a class variable affects all instances (unless it's shadowed by an instance variable).\n",

        "       dog2 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        "   The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent or sibling class. It's especially important in inheritance, including multiple inheritance, to ensure proper method resolution and to avoid redundancy.\n",

        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "ðŸ”¹ How it works:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "   Method chaining is a technique where multiple method calls are linked together in a single statement, by having each method return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "ðŸ”¹ How it Works:\n",
        " * Each method performs some action and then returns the same object (self) so that the next method can be called on it.\n",
